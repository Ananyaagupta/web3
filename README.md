We are a group that aims at making society a better place to live.
We have developed a website which provides an easy medium for donors to donate their clothes to people in need, at the same time rewarding the donors and promnoting local vendors.

## Our Aim

Our aim is to ensure the we cover every body that lacks proper clothing ensuring basic living standards for the under-privileged.

## Our Working

- The user will be asked to sign up as Donor or Availer.

- If the the person chooses to donate he will be redirected to a page where he can specify the type of clothing and size of cloth he wants to donate. 
After making a successful donation the person will be given some credits which can be exchanged for new clothes.

- If the person Signs Up as an availer he will be provided with choices of clothes available which the person/organisaton can easily buy.

- The availer will be verifying being delivered with the cloth using blockchain themself ensuring the cloth actually reaches the needy.

- Donators will earn points for each succesful donation which they can later redeem as coupons for shopping at local buinesses.

- Thus local buisnesses will also be able to reach a bigger set of audience and advertise using our platform

#### The medium will provide the following benefits :

- Ensuring the under-privileged get enough clothing
- Promoting local shops and businesses
- Answer to the major question of How and Where to donat?
